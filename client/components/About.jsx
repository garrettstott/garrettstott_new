          <h4>Bio</h4>
          <p>
          I've always had a love for all things computery. I have been building computers since I received my first job. For over 15 years I have been building, repairing and been general IT for friends and family. A year ago, after tinkering with basic HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript, I discovered a new passion in my life. I decided to change my career and life forever. I found a great web development Bootcamp, paid off most of my debts, and set my life up to be able to afford to take 3 months of my life and put them into the intense world, at DevPoint Labs.
          </p>
          <p>
          Prior to the Bootcamp, I spent a year studying. I spent a lot of time online using free courses, such as CodeCademy. I also utilized Udemy. I finished many courses ranging from JavaScript, building full Rails apps, BDD and TDD, and other web development courses covering many topics. During the 3 months at DevPoint Labs, we put a lot of focus on Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, and everything web development. It was a great learning experience. I learned that being in the web development world, I will forever be a student, constantly learning new technologies.
          </p>
          <p>
          I am currently a co-instructor at DevPoint Labs and a contract web developer.
